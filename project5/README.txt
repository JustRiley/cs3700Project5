Our high level approach consisted of following the recommended steps one by one, implementing different parts of the raft protocol. We first started off with the election protocol and tried it under different test cases to simulate different scenarios. Once we got that working, we started to implement appendentry rpc messages, and the additional restrictions specified. Then, we worked through the test cases, going from easy to hard, trying to debug using print statements to track what was going on. The trickiest were the advanced cases, which required a lot of thinking as many different scenarios could be happening at once. The biggest challenges were fixing edge cases or scenarios that occurred infrequently, as that made it much harder to reproduce and debug.
